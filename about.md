Hi there!

I'm Davide De Pretto, a data engineer and backend software developer from Verona, Italy.

I know and work primarily with T-SQL/SQL Server, Typescript/NodeJS, and the Azure ecosystem. Still, I'm also highly interested in C#/.NET for its expressiveness and power tooling and the rest of Microsoft Data Platform, such as CosmosDB and other storage solutions.

Currently, I'm working in the R&D department at [Trueblue](https://truebluecorp.com), architecting and building sizeable enterprise-grade data platforms and web services for the pharmaceutical industry. I'm also studying to get some Microsoft Azure certifications so that I can flex them on Linkedin.

When I'm not sitting at my desk building stuff, I enjoy listening to music, eating fine food, and drinking good wine.
